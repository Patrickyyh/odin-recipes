        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a classic Italian potato salad that can be found on
            tables from the north to the south. Meaning "parsley potatoes", you'll find Patate Prezzemolate everywhere in Italy: formal luncheons, family get-togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in school cafeterias. Buon appetito!
        </p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size.
                Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl.
                Add garlic and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss,
                taking care not to break the potatoes.</li>
        </ol>
